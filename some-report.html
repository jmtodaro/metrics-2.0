As part of the Tor Metrics Project, we want to learn how many people use
the Tor network on a daily basis.
Counting users in an anonymity network is, obviously, a difficult task
for which we cannot collect too sensitive usage data.
We came up with a privacy-preserving approach for estimating directly
connecting user numbers by counting requests to the directory mirrors and
deriving approximate user numbers from there.
In this report we describe a modified approach for estimating the number
of users connecting via bridges by evaluating directory requests made to
bridges.
We compare this new approach to our current approach that estimates bridge
user numbers from total unique IP addresses seen at bridges.
We think that results from the new approach are closer to reality, even
though that means there are significantly fewer daily bridge users than
originally expected.</td></tr>
