<h2>How Tor Metrics preserves user privacy</h2>

<p>The metrics on this website are based on different data sources in the
Tor network.
Some of these data sources are not sensitive at all, like properties and
capabilities of a relay.
Others are more sensitive, like statistics on fetched directory listings
by country.
Yet others are simply too sensitive to gather at all, like contents of
unencrypted connections leaving the Tor network, so we don't have metrics
on those.</p>

<p>We wrote a
<a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wecsr10measuring-tor">research
paper</a> where we describe how we measure potentially sensitive data in
the Tor network.
Whenever we plan to add new data, this plan needs to go through a rigorous
process of writing a
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/001-process.txt">proposal
document</a>, which is usually discussed on the
<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev">public
development list</a>, and publicly reviewing code patches on the
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor">bug tracker</a>.
Furthermore, as a core principle, we only use data for metrics that have
been made publicly available:
if the raw data are too sensitive to publish, then we shouldn't even
publish aggregate statistics of it.
</p>

<h2>Contributing to Tor Metrics</h2>

<p>We welcome all kinds of contributions that help people understand the
Tor network better and at the same time <i>do not put Tor users at
risk</i>.
Here's an overview of possible contributions to Tor Metrics:</p>

<center>
<img src="contributing.png" width="500" />
</center>

<br/>

<p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a new metric:</strong>
Did you come up with an idea to visualize existing Tor network data in a
way that is not available on Tor Metrics yet?
We can easily host non-interactive graphs or tables on this website, and
we can add links to possibly interactive graphs or other metrics hosted by
yourself.
You're free to use any pre-aggregated data provided by Tor Metrics, Tor
network status data provided by the
<a href="https://onionoo.torproject.org/">Onionoo service</a>, or raw
descriptors provided by the
<a href="https://collector.torproject.org/">CollecTor service</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Run custom experiment:</strong>
Are you considering to run an experiment on the Tor network and to share
your data and findings?
We can host both your data and your visualizations on this website and
make them available to a wider audience.
But let us emphasize the "do not put Tor users at risk" part again here.
If you're unsure whether your experiment might be used to harm users,
please talk to us before starting it.</li>
<li><strong>Add/update metric generated by Tor Metrics:</strong>
We happily accept contributions to the Metrics code base that add or
update metrics provided on this website.
This requires effort on your side for writing a patch and on our side to
review it, but the result is a fully integrated, interactive metric and an
honorable mention for creating it.
We're happy to provide assistance in writing such a patch.</li>
<li><strong>Add/update data-aggregating script run by Tor
Metrics:</strong>
If you're really brave, you may want to contribute a patch to the
data-processing scripts that update the data provided on this website.
The cool thing is that future metrics may be based on your data, so this
is really the most effective way of contributing to Tor Metrics.
And there's an honorable mention in it, too.
Please come talk to us if this sounds like a fun adventure to you.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The general approach for contributing to Tor Metrics is to open a
ticket in the
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor">issue tracker</a>
using the "Metrics Website" component and discuss your contribution there.
And no worries, if you have a good idea but can't implement it on your
own, please suggest it anyway!
But please understand that adding a new graph or table may be harder than
it seems and take longer than you may expect.

<h2>How to cite Tor Metrics in a research paper</h2>

<p>
If you're writing a research paper that uses data or metrics from this
website, attribution is appreciated.
Most people cite the following
<a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wecsr10measuring-tor">research
paper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Karsten Loesing, Steven J. Murdoch, and Roger Dingledine.
A Case Study on Measuring Statistical Data in the Tor Anonymity
Network.
<i>In Proceedings of the Workshop on Ethics in Computer Security
Research (WECSR 2010), Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain, January
2010.</i></p>

<pre>
@inproceedings{wecsr10measuring-tor,
  title = {A Case Study on Measuring Statistical Data in the {T}or Anonymity Network},
  author = {Karsten Loesing and Steven J. Murdoch and Roger Dingledine},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the Workshop on Ethics in Computer Security Research (WECSR 2010)},
  year = {2010},
  month = {January},
  location = {Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain},
  publisher = {Springer},
  series = {LNCS},
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alternatively, you can of course cite this website directly.
Be careful with links to specific metrics though.
In most cases, citing <tt>https://metrics.torproject.org/</tt> should be
sufficient.
