<h2>Data format</h2>

Statistics file servers.csv contains the average number of relays and
bridges in the Tor network.  All averages are calculated per day by
evaluating the relay and bridge lists published by the directory
authorities.  Statistics include subsets of relays or bridges by relay
flag (only relays), country code (only relays, only until February 2013),
Tor software version (only relays), operating system (only relays), and
EC2 cloud (only bridges).  The statistics file contains the following
columns:

<ul>
<li>date: UTC date (YYYY-MM-DD) when relays or bridges have been listed as
running.</li>
<li>flag: Relay flag assigned by the directory authorities.  Examples are
"Exit", "Guard", "Fast", "Stable", and "HSDir".  Relays can have none,
some, or all these relay flags assigned.  Relays that don't have the
"Running" flag are not included in these statistics regardless of their
other flags.  If this column contains the empty string, all running
relays are included, regardless of assigned flags.  There are no
statistics on the number of bridges by relay flag.</li>
<li>country: Two-letter lower-case country code as found in a GeoIP
database by resolving the relay's first onion-routing IP address, or
"??" if an IP addresses could not be resolved.  If this column contains
the empty string, all running relays are included, regardless of their
resolved country code.  Statistics on relays by country code are only
available until January 31, 2013.  There are no statistics on the
number of bridges by country code.</li>
<li>version: First three dotted numbers of the Tor software version as
reported by the relay.  An example is "0.2.5".  If this column contains
the empty string, all running relays are included, regardless of the
Tor software version they run.  There are no statistics on the number
of bridges by Tor software version.</li>
<li>platform: Operating system as reported by the relay.  Examples are
"Linux", "Darwin" (Mac OS X), "FreeBSD", "Windows", and "Other".  If
this column contains the empty string, all running relays are included,
regardless of the operating system they run on.  There are no
statistics on the number of bridges by operating system.</li>
<li>ec2bridge: Whether bridges are running in the EC2 cloud or not.  More
precisely, bridges in the EC2 cloud running an image provided by Tor by
default set their nickname to "ec2bridger" plus 8 random hex
characters.  This column either contains "t" for bridges matching this
naming scheme, or the empty string for all bridges regardless of their
nickname.  There are no statistics on the number of relays running in
the EC2 cloud.</li>
<li>relays: The average number of relays matching the criteria in the
previous columns.  If the values in previous columns are specific to
bridges only, this column contains the empty string.</li>
<li>bridges: The average number of bridges matching the criteria in the
previous columns.  If the values in previous columns are specific to
relays only, this column contains the empty string.</li>
</ul>

Design prototype note:
There are currently four types of metrics pages: graph, table, data, link.
There is one data page per data file.
This page explains the data file and specifies its format.
Adding new data pages should be easy.
